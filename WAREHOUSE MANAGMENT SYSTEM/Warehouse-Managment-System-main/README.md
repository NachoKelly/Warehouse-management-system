CHAPTER ONE: RESEARCH INTRODUCTION
1.1	Executive Summary
This chapter contains research objectives, background information, study justification, study limitations and problem scope. 
1.2	Research Objectives
1.2.1	General Objective

i.	To develop a warehouse system that would smoothens out market supply and speed the products movements to the customers by performing additional services like marketing prices and packaging products.
1.2.2	Specific Objectives
i.	To develop a module for customers to removed goods.
ii.	To develop a module for customers to added goods
iii.	To develop a module for displaying the good available to be requested. 
iv.	To develop a module for keeping of records of good sold out.
v.	To develop a module for printing transcript of the goods sold.
vi.	To develop a module for customers to log in
vii.	To develop a module for customers to log out.


3.2 System Requirements Specification
	3.2.1 Functional Requirements

From my literature survey, these are the elements that the system should have for it to be usable:
i.	Sign up and sign in features 
ii.	Catalogue page 
iii.	Description features for every product
iv.	Add to cart features 
v.	Online payment
vi.	Customer record keeping 
vii.	Customer review page 
	3.2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
The following will not affect the usability of the system but will make it more efficient long term, even though they may or may not be implemented dependent on whether I meet the system’s specific objectives, in the given time:
i.	System security 
ii.	Platform compatibility



3.3. Design
	3.3.1 Low Level Design

Pseudocode
      Input validations
	If input is correct
		Allow user to login
	else
		shows error message
		user tries again the second time
	When login successful
	Browse catalogue of products available,
		See product details and prices,
		Add to cart/remove
		Pay
		If payment is less than the user’s balance
	Generate order
             Then prints transcript of the goods sold
		Else
                  display error message
	Back to cart


	
	3.3.2 High Level Design

Dashboard:














3.4 Implementation / Development
	3.4.1 Language(s), Frameworks and Other Technical Requirements
My Intention is to develop the system using VB .net for back end and front-end development.


	3.4.2 Code Review Strategy


3.5 Testing
	3.5.1 Functional Requirements Testing

I will conduct system testing to ensure that the system works as was designed in low-level design.


	3.5.2 Non-Functional Requirements Testing
I will test the system on different Operating System to see if it would run on different cross- platforms.



3.6 Deployment


I intend to use bare metal deployment technique where I am going to create an executable file for my system and run it on my laptop.
